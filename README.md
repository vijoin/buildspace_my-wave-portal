# Buildspace project: WavePortal
link: https://buildspace.so/solidity

## Build a Web3 App on Ethereum with Solidity + Smart Contracts
Make the jump from React to Web3. A short, weekend project where you'll learn some Solidity, write + deploy a smart contract to the ETH blockchain, and build a Web3 client app to interact with your contract.

## What's this project about
* a website called the WavePortal --- it's a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract.
* a website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with the smart contract.
* when someone waves at you there is a random chance they can win a small amount of ETH from the site.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
